I am a first year PhD student at [NeuroPoly](https://neuro.polymtl.ca/index.html) under the supervision of [Benjamin De Leener](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/de-leener-benjamin). I am also co-supervised by [Vincent Noblet](https://images.icube.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Vincent_Noblet) from Télécom Physique Strasbourg. My project aims to identify relationships between brain structure, genomic variations and potential neurological disorders in pediatric populations. To accomplish this objective, we will build a reference model of brain neurodevelopment as well as an age-related predictive model relating to the potential risk of neurological disorders from brain MRI and genomic data.
